# Description

Inspired by [VapourVim](https://github.com/cunialino/VapourNvim)

## Improvements

- [ ] **IMPORTANT:** Enable some keybindings just when plugin is loaded, or think of other imprvements like for the preview.
- [ ] Extensive dap support, add more languages
- [ ] Test alternatives to JupyterAscending. I don't like it that much.


- [x] Add [JupyterAscending](https://github.com/untitled-ai/jupyter_ascending.vim), will do when I'll actually need this

  - [ ] Better config on saving for jupyter ascending. I would like to save just the notebook with no sync in the name.

- [x] Add [DAP](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap)

- [x] Try out [nvim-lint](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint) and [formatter](https://github.com/mhartington/formatter.nvim) instead of null-ls

  - I would like this solution better because it separates linting and formatting.
