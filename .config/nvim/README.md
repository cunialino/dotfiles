# Description

My neovim config

## Improvements

- [ ] Test [nui](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim) and [dressing](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim)

- [x] **IMPORTANT:** Enable some keybindings just when plugin is loaded, or think of other imprvements like for the preview.
- [x] Extensive dap support, add more languages
- [x] Test alternatives to JupyterAscending. I don't like it that much. Magma + jupytext



- [x] Add [DAP](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap)

- [x] Try out [nvim-lint](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint) and [formatter](https://github.com/mhartington/formatter.nvim) instead of null-ls
